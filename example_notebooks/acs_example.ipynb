    "# Drizzled PSFs from _HST_/ACS Imaging\n",
    "\n",
    "This example notebook shows how `spike` interacts with _HST_/ACS imaging to generate a drizzled PSF. This notebook uses observations from [this program](https://archive.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/mastpreview?mission=hst&amp;dataid=J8PU42010). The easiest way to find these data in the MAST archive is by searching for observation ID j8pu42010. `spike` uses calibrated, but not-yet co-added images (i.e., \"Level 2\" data products), so be sure that your download includes 'flc' files. If you download all of the files associated with this program, your working directory will include:\n",
    "- j8pu42ecq_flc.fits\n",
    "- j8pu42egq_flc.fits\n",
    "- j8pu42esq_flc.fits\n",
    "- j8pu42evq_flc.fits\n",
    "\n",
    "The principle of this example notebook is the same regardless of dataset, though, so it can be used as a direct guide for use with other data, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "_NOTE: Environment variables are not always read in properly within Jupyter notebooks/JupyterLab -- see [here](https://github.com/avapolzin/spike/blob/master/example_notebooks/README.md) for some additional details of how to access them._"

To change the parameters within a method (e.g., updating model arguments, setting different detection thresholds for the empirical PSFs, ...), `spike.psf.hst` directly takes keyword arguments for specified 'method'. Details of allowed arguments are available in the `spike.psfgen` [documentation](https://spike-psf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/psfgen.html).
