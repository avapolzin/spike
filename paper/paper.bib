abstract = {This work presents two software components aimed to relieve the costs of accessing high-performance parallel computing resources within a Python programming environment: MPI for Python and PETSc for Python. MPI for Python is a general-purpose Python package that provides bindings for the Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard using any back-end MPI implementation. Its facilities allow parallel Python programs to easily exploit multiple processors using the message passing paradigm. PETSc for Python provides access to the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation (PETSc) libraries. Its facilities allow sequential and parallel Python applications to exploit state of the art algorithms and data structures readily available in PETSc for the solution of large-scale problems in science and engineering. MPI for Python and PETSc for Python are fully integrated to PETSc-FEM, an MPI and PETSc based parallel, multiphysics, finite elements code developed at CIMEC laboratory. This software infrastructure supports research activities related to simulation of fluid flows with applications ranging from the design of microfluidic devices for biochemical analysis to modeling of large-scale stream/aquifer interactions.}

abstract = {MPI for Python provides bindings of the message passing interface (MPI) standard for the Python programming language and allows any Python program to exploit multiple processors. In its first release, MPI for Python was constructed on top of the MPI-1 specification defining an object-oriented interface that closely followed the MPI-2 C++ bindings, and provided support for communications of general Python objects. In the latest release, this package is improved to enable direct blocking/non-blocking communication of numeric arrays, and to support almost all MPI-2 features. Improvements in communication performance have been tested in a Beowulf class cluster. Results showed a negligible overhead in comparison to compiled C code. MPI for Python is open source and available for download on the web (http://mpi4py.scipy.org/).}
